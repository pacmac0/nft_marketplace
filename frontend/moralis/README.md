This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
```bash
yarn create next-app .
```
First, run the development server:
```bash
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This is going to be our frontend with Moralis functinality for the NFT-Marketplace.

Unfortuanetly Moralis is sunsetting its server hosting with its version 2.0 currently  eing rolled out. 
Therefore this project, specifically the keeping track of active listings with the database, is impossible to follow. A self hosted server would be required.

#### Features
1. Homepage with connect wallet option
2. Show listed Nft's
3. make them purchaseable
4. If you own it you can update the listing
